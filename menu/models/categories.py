"""
Global category tagging — bulk suggestion + admin review flow.

This file is organized in four sections, meant to live in their
respective places in the project (models.py / services/tagging.py /
views.py / urls.py). Kept together here for easy review.

Design decisions this implements:
- MenuCategory <-> GlobalTag is many-to-many (a category can legitimately
  match more than one tag, e.g. "Grilled Chicken" -> Chicken + Grilled).
- Suggestions are business-scoped and bulk: walk every category for a
  business in one call, so the admin reviews/edits everything together
  instead of tag-by-tag.
- Already-attached tags are excluded from "suggested" so the admin only
  sees new candidates, not stuff they've already accepted.
- No external dependencies (no Postgres trigram extension required) —
  pure Python scoring so it works regardless of DB backend. If you're
  on Postgres and want faster/better fuzzy matching at scale later,
  swap _similarity_score's SequenceMatcher for TrigramSimilarity.
